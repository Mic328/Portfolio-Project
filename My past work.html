            <h2> Monster journals</h2>
            <p> During my tween to teed years, I've been making monster journals where I draw a monster I imagined from my head and drawn it into a journal and coloring it afterwards. The first monsters I drew looks like a kid draw them with the lines being squiggly and proportions being out of proportion. But as time went on my drawings became better and better as the lines are more straight, the proportions being more fixed, the limbs not being as swollen or thin to each other, and drawing actually shoulder/leg joints.</p>

        <h2 id=Egypt> My music video </h2>
        <p> During the middle of winter, my Multimedia design teacher assigned me and other students to make a music video using our own images instead of online images. I thought up on what to do and I decided to draw my own images that connect to each other like you'd see in a comic book. So I choose the music to be "Unawakening Float" by the band "Crush 40" and make the music video into an story about the plagues of Egypt from the Egyptian gods' point of view. I personally think it was a good start for me in terms of making animation as I was able to do a fighting scene between RA and God with the fight scenes being choreographed in a comic book format. It's not real animation, but the project itself is a good started point for me.</p>
        <h2 id=Egypt> The experimental video</h2>
        <p> I made another video for Multimedia during the early-middle spring where I did an experimental video that combines footage, my videos, and images into my own video project. While the first half of the video is a composite of footage, the 2nd half has a series of drawn image that go together to form a story like you see in those comic book videos where the videos show one page of a comic book to the next to give you a sense of progression. In the video, I give the scenes the of an animation-like movement compared to the music video I made and I think I did pretty well all things considered.</p>
