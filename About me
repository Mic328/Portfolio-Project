            <h2> Most significant moments in my life</h2>
            <p>There are alot of moments in my life that made me the way I am. However if there is one event that is the most important for me personally, it's the day I woke up at 4:00 AM and watched Inuyasha on Toonami. I've always had an interested in animation since I was a little kid and want to create the same shows like they did. However the shows I wanted to create are sitcom-like shows which are most prevalent in adult animation. Inuyasha however is an anime action show filled with suspense, romance, action, and emotion. For me, the show was so awesome that want to make something like it. This event alone forge a path for me to create an animated series that'll defy that norm that is the animated sitcom. Ironically, if I never got up early on that day, I would've wanted to create another animated sitcom instead of the revolutionary cartoons I've dreamt of inside my head.</p>

        <h2 id=Michael> About me</h2>
        <p> My name is Michael Mcgrath and I'm a student at MCC who's working to get an AAS degree in digital media in order to gain a job at the animation industry so that I can create my own animated show that'll break the norm of mainstream animation. I'm a creative individual who's quite good at writing a story as well as developing characters and knows how to make an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere. I also happen to be quite productive as I usually gets things done when they need to be as long as I got a direct pay that is. I'm willing to work for any animation studio and entertainment studio so long as they allow me complete creative future over any future series I wish to create. I do need abit of help sometimes incase I don't understand some things or if I didn't get some social cues at all. But other than that, I'm a great employee to pick if anyone needs another series that'll bring in the profits while winning the hearts of many consumers.</p>
        <h2 id=Michael> My history</h2>
        <p> I was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin on April 10th,2002, and raised in Walworth County with my parents alongside my sister. I would spend my days watching videos on the internet, watching tv, playing video games, and going to school. I would then move to Tacoma, Washington with my family for months before moving to Illinois, where I would spend my late childhood and early teenhood there growing an interest in animation and fiction. This interest would lead me to what to become an animator and create my own animated cartoon series that'll redefine what people see animation as. I decided to go to the tech campus during the 2nd half of my time in high school in order to learn how to draw on a digital drawing pad. Though I had to do Multimedia since Digital drawing class is cancelled which go me more experience in Graphic design than the subject I'm more interested in. Though i'd did get the chance to improve my drawing ability and create project that so be the precursor to my soon to be animations. Once I graduated high school, I registered for Mchenry County College and started taking classes there to gain an AAS degree in digital media which brings me here today.</p>
