            <h2> What to do with my private life?</h2>
            <p> As for what I want to do with my private life, I'm going to a place that's closest to the animation i'm gonna be working at due on where i'm gonna be working at. I also plan to have a wife with an adopted child since there are kids out there without parents to support them and it's good to bring a kid into a new family to give them happiness. Beside babies are more of a pain to deal with than children are anyways.</p>

        <h2 id=Dream> My dream job</h2>
        <p>One of the things I plan to do in life is to do is being the creative director of my animated franchise. The reason I wish to go on that career path is that I’ve always been fascinated with fictional media like video games, anime, and western cartoons. This fascination inspired me to make one of my very own cartoons for the fun of it. But as I grew older, I’m starting to think that I shouldn’t just work in the cartoon industry because I wish to, but because I had to. I feel like animation (mainly adult animation) is stagnating right now. In the past, America used to be the king of pop culture when it comes to movies, games, and cartoons with Japan being it's rival in those industries. But due to animation being viewed as an entire genre by the west rather the medium it is, western animation has started to stagnate depending on the area you're looking at. This is most notable with adult animation as the Simpsons and Family which were once revolutionary cartoons have now flooded the adult animation market with nothing more than generic animated sitcoms that try to edgy and hilarious which they fail to do so. Since I feel like I’m the one person to bring animation back on its feet.  </p>
        <h2 id=Dream> Other goals in mind</h2>
        <p>I've also been thinking about travel to different places around the world as so to know the different cultures and peoples there as well as gaining new and positive experiences I never usually get. These places include Japan, Brazil, Russia, Germany, India, Mexico, Egypt, Greece, and etc. Japan since they are the kings of 2d animation, video games, and manga nowadays, Brazil cause of the amazon rainforest and the vibrant aesthetic, Russia/Germany cause they are my 2 favorite European civilizations, Egypt because of my interest in Egyptian mythology, India because of the fascinating culture, Greece because of it's history, and Mexico cause of it's history, culture, and food. I've also been thinking of starting my own career as a Youtuber as a part time job or hobby. I'll upload videos like discussions on animation and the state of the industry itself, my own animations, or some memes for the fun of it. </p>
